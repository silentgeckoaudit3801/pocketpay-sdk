# Logging Guidance

Safe logging practices for applications using the PocketPay SDK.

## Never Log Secret Keys

Secret keys grant full control over Stellar accounts. Never log them.

### Unsafe

```typescript
console.log('Using key:', secretKey);
logger.info('Signing with', { secretKey });
console.error('Failed to sign', { key: secretKey, error });
```

### Safe

```typescript
console.log('Signing transaction from public key:', publicKey);
logger.info('Transaction signed', { publicKey, txHash });
console.error('Signing failed', { publicKey, error: err.message });
```

## Data That Must Never Be Logged

Never write the following values to console output, app logs, crash reports, or
third-party log aggregation systems:

- Secret keys, seed phrases, private signing material, or wallet backup blobs
- Raw signed transactions or envelopes before submission
- Full transaction payloads that include memos, destination accounts, amounts,
  or user-provided metadata unless each field has been reviewed and redacted
- Authorization headers, API keys, bearer tokens, session identifiers, or device
  push tokens
- Complete error objects from wallet, signing, or Horizon/Soroban submission
  paths when those objects may include request bodies or user input

## Safe Identifiers to Log

These are safe to include in logs:

| Data | Safe | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| Public keys (G...) | Yes | Public by design |
| Transaction hashes | Yes | Already on-chain |
| Ledger numbers | Yes | Public data |
| Contract IDs | Yes | Public identifiers |
| Error messages | Yes | Strip sensitive context |
| Operation types | Yes | Not sensitive |

## Logging PocketPayError

When logging errors from the SDK, include structured metadata but exclude secrets:

```typescript
try {
  await sdk.sendPayment({ destination, amount, secretKey });
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof PocketPayError) {
    logger.error('Payment failed', {
      code: error.code,
      message: error.message,
      destination,
      amount,
    });
  }
  throw error;
}
```

## Debug Logging Expectations

Debug mode may include extra timing, network, and SDK-state context, but it must
still use the same redaction rules as production logging. Prefer small,
structured fields that are already public or derived from public data.

### Unsafe Debug Logging

```typescript
logger.debug('submitting payment', { secretKey, transactionXdr, requestBody });
logger.debug('wallet created', wallet);
```

### Safe Debug Logging

```typescript
logger.debug('submitting payment', {
  sourcePublicKey,
  destinationPublicKey,
  assetCode,
  amount,
  horizonNetworkPassphrase,
});

logger.debug('payment submitted', {
  txHash,
  ledger,
  operationCount,
});
```

When in doubt, log an event name, public account, transaction hash, ledger, or
SDK error code instead of the raw input that produced it.

## Environment-Specific Logging

### Development

More detail is acceptable for debugging. Still exclude secret keys, raw
transactions, authorization values, and unredacted user payloads.

### Production

Log only what is needed for monitoring. Redact or omit all sensitive fields.

## Security Checklist

- Secret keys never appear in log output
- Raw signed transactions and full transaction payloads are not logged
- Authorization headers, API keys, bearer tokens, and session identifiers are redacted
- Log aggregation services have access controls
- Log retention policies are defined
- Error stack traces are suppressed in production
- Transaction hashes and public keys are treated as non-sensitive
